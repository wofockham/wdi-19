/*
The Movie Database

It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!

Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).

Create a function to print out the movie information like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."

var movie = {
  title: 'O Brother! Where Art Thou?',
  duration: 117,
  stars: ['George Clooney', 'Gillian Welch', 'That Really Slinty Guy']
};

var movieInfo = function (m) {
  var description = m.title + " lasts for " + m.duration +
                    " minutes. Stars: " + m.stars.join(', ') + ".";

  console.log(description);
};

movieInfo( movie );
