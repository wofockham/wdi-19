The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numChildren = 8;
var partnerName = 'Jonesy';
var geographicLocation = 'Hawaii';
var jobTitle = 'chimney sweep';

var fortune = "You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geographicLocation + ", and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren + " kids.";
console.log(fortune);
